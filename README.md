# Kaggle-Exercise-Basic-Python
The first few exercises I did from Kaggle's Beginner Python course.

I found Kaggle from a podcast called DataFramed by DataCamp. I started to research about it and finally created notebooks.
I am new to Kaggle but I love it! I am learning so much more and I can't wait to improve my skills in Data Science!
